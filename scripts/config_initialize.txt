# These are custominstallerbuilder's dependencies. They are essentially
# a RepyV2 runtime with libraries, because `common/build_manager.py`
# uses seattlelib_v2'2 `rsa.r2py` functionality to generate crypto
# keys for named vessel users.
#
# Note that base installers are *not* part of this config!
# They are handled by SeattleTestbed/installer-packaging.
