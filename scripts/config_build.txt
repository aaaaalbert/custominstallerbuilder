# Build file for the Repy runtime that the custominstallerbuilder requires. 
# (Essentially repy_v2's plus Affix).
#
# If it were not for the problems with repyportability / repyhelper / 
# dylink, the custominstallerbuilder code could do plain Python `import`'s 
# from Repy files, and be done. Since that doesn't work currently, 
# we build a directory containing the full runtime instead.
# Be sure to revisit this workaround whenever progress is made on 
# SeattleTestbed/portability#25 through 28!
#
# Note that the base installers are *not* part of this config!
# They are handled by SeattleTestbed/installer-packaging.
